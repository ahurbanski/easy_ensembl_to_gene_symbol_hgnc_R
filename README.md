# easy_ensembl_to_gene_symbol_hgnc_R
Converts a list of genes in ensembl format to HGNC gene symbol format using biomaRt

You can start from (see example files in this repository):

  a) an expression matrix file (where the ENSEMBL genes are in the FIRST column);

  b) a simple list of ENSEMBL genes (ONE gene per line)
